## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Department for Transport is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies
(Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018, this site has been tested for accessibility.

## How accessible this website is

This website conforms to AA and AAA accessibility standards, but we know some aspects of this website are not fully
accessible:

- you are not able to turn off or adjust the time in which inactivity will result in a loss of data, (which is 1 hour).

    A user session expires an hour after they last performed any interaction with the site that resulted in a page load - that is any form submission, or link or button click.

    A short session time is a requirement for security reasons and a recommendation of security testing.

    To allow you to continue to use the website if you need more time on a particular page, we have implemented a warning banner which appears when a session of inactivity has five minutes remaining and provides a link allowing you to extend your session.
