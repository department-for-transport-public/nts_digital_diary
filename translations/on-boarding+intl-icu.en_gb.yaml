    **Thank you for agreeing to take part in the National Travel Survey.**
    
    To help with our research, we are asking each member of your household to keep a week-long travel diary. Everyone will have their own online travel diary to complete.
    
    If you need to complete the diaries for other members of your household, please let your NatCen interviewer know and they will show you how to do this.
